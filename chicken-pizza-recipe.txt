Ingredients:

1/2 recipe homemade pizza crust
1/3 cup + 2 Tablespoons your favorite BBQ sauce
1 cup cooked, sliced chicken breast (about one 8-ounce breast)
2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2/3 cup shredded smoked gouda cheese1
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
fresh cilantro, for topping

Directions:

1. Prepare the pizza dough through step 11, including preheating the oven to 475F
as described in step 8.

2. Toss 2 Tablespoons of BBQ sauce with the cooked, chopped chicken to coat it.
Set aside.

3. After waiting 15 minutes as described in step 11, top the crust with the BBQ
sauce. Add more or less BBQ sauce depending on your taste. Then layer on the shredded
mozzarella, then the BBQ-coated chicken, shredded gouda, then the onion slices.
Bake for 14-16 minutes. For the last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack
to really brown the edges. That's optional.

4. Top hot pizza with fresh cilantro. Slice pizza and serve immediately. Store leftover
pizza covered tightly in the refrigerator and reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza
slices may be frozen up to 1 month. Please see homemade pizza crust recipe for
how to freeze the pizza dough.
